D2RaidTool is meant to be a quick access item manager for the game Destiny 2. The goal is to allow users to quickly open the app and see all of their favorite raid weapons or just general favorite weapons and quickly swap them to where they want them to go. This avoids the need to navigate a bunch of menus and be fast while in a raid group.
